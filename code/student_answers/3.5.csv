 They differentiated by the compiler by the conditions/inputs used for one of the overloaded functions.,3
" The compiler distinguishes overloaded functions by their signatures. It encodes each function identifier with the number and types of its parameters to generate type-safe linkage, which ensures the proper overloaded function is called.",5
" Overloaded functions are distinguished by their signatures, Name mangling or name decoration, and type-safe linkage ensures that proper overloaded functions is called and types of the arguments conform to tpes to the parameters.",5

 overloaded function simply invovles haing a method with the same name within the class. is used to implement a method for subclass which overrides in other words replaces the implementation of the super class. Overloading the concept of providing different meaning to a object based on the context of its presence. Overloading is one type of polymorphism and this is also a feature in programing. ,3
