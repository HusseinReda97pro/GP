 You can add an element to the end of the linked list and update a pointer called top each time you modify the list.,3
 You implement a list in which the head pointer points to the element most recently pushed onto the list and the pop function changes the head pointer to point to the next to last element in the list and removes the element head pointer previously pointed to.,5
 This is the implementation of the stack using single linked list.  The operations performed on a stack are  1)push(): This is the function which is for insertion(pushing)of an element into stack                    It is similar to the insertion of an element at the end of a single linked list                 see  the function insert_end() in the program for operations of single linked list  2)pop(): This is the function which is for deletion(popping up) of an element from the stack           It is similar to the deletion of an element at the end of a single linked list     see  the function delete_end() in the program for operations of single linked list  3)stack_display():This is the function which is for displaying the elements of a stack,4
 Using nodes to keep track of the head of the stack. Then using Push( ) and Pop ( ) to create the stack as needed.,4
" Use the head as the top of the stack, only modify the head when you push/pop... push would add a new item to the head, pop would remove the item from the head.",4.5
 you implement a stack with a list by changing the pointer to the first element of the list to the new item and move the pointer from the top of the stack to the next item when removing an item.,4.5
 You dynamicly create space as the stack grows.  The stack can be as long as you need.,2.5
" Declare a pointer that points to the head of the linked list, only add and remove nodes from the beginning of the list.",5
 Creating a linked list. Add an element to the top of the stack when pushing and deleting an element when popping.,4
" A singly-linked list is already a lot like a stack, it just depends on the way you address moving the head.",3.5
" make a list, make the bottom the head, add on the end and make the end top",3.5
 use the add function with a list as the beginning of the stack and remove for pop,4.5
 Use head as the top and push and pop nodes from the head.,4.5
 create a node based list that points to the next list item down.,1.5
" have the head of the list be the last item added, and a push just adds a new head.",4.5
" Create a new list. Pop elements in the stack as needed. Push the stack to remove items, unless the stack is empty.The top item is at the head of the list.The last item is at the end.",4.5
 adding the element to the end of the list so that it links to the element before it. when popping the element it takes the last element in the list and sets the previous one as the end of the list.,3.5
" You can implement a stack using arrays or and linked list. By the use of pointers, that point element(node) to the next element in the stack. By the use of pointers, the stack becomes a linked list.",2.5
 Elements are only inserted and removed from the head of the list.  There is no header node or current pointer.,4.5
 use a linked list and keep track of a pointer that points to the first item,4
" A singly linked list can already be easily used for LIFO data storage. Members of a stack can simply be pushed and popped from a list, the first item in will be the last out.",4.5
 using pointer ,1.5
 the top is the first pointer.,3
" Keep a pointer pointing to the last element entered at the front of the array and move the pointer ""back"" when you delete an element.",2.5
" using linked list, you are pushing the node that contains each int to the stack until you get to the end of your linked list",2.5
" have a linked list, and for each push, add an item onto beginning of the list, and for each pop remove the first element in the list.",5
" Using a linked list is one way to implement a stack so that it can handle essentially any number of elements. It is usually convenient to put a data structure in its own module, thus, you'll want to create files stack.h and a stack.c",2
