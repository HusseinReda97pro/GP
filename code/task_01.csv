"white::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature, then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperature is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.",2
dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold. The average of the four averages was 47(DEG)c so i chose the closest one to 47(DEG) c and dark gray was 48(DEG)c so that's why i chose dark gray.,2
"black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there",2
white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.,2
black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.,2
white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.,1
"black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.",1
white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.,1
dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.,1
light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold,1
white :: white duns not atat so mush heat,0
"white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog.",0
"white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.",0
light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse,0
light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.,0
