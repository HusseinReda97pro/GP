0, When you traverse a tree of any size you will visit each node three times.  Its on the order of 3n or O(n) running time.,4
1," The Euler tour traversal of a tree begins at the root and visits each node in the tree from the left, then bottom, then right sides.",5
2, Where you visit the in order according to its data value.,3
3," It is a tree that shows how it functions. It contains parents, children, siblings, ancestors and descendents. The use of tree type algorithm is also an alternative sorting algorithm. ",2
4," Start from the root, circle around the _whole_ ""tree"", naming each node as you see it.",4.5
5, it is where you visit the parent then you vistit the children,1.5
6," To start from the root , traveling left and visiting ever child along the way till you return to the root from the right.",4
7," Traversing a tree down to it's terminal child and then all of it's siblings, then it traverses up the terminal child's parent and all of it's siblings (repeating the first step if those siblings have children) until the root node has been visited.",4
8, The Euler tour traversal of a tree the function that iteratively keeps track of the pointer on each node.,3
9," You travel the outside edge of the tree, clockwise, while naming each node.",4
10, children to root,2
11, go to the bottom of the left sub tree and visit the parent and then its children,3
12, The Euler tour traverses through the tree in a rubber-band style shape.,3.5
13," The Euler tour traversal of a tree is a specific way of navigating a tree that involves following the tree starting at the very top and moving along the left side of the tree first, cupping in to visit the parents of children nodes.  It allows for each node to be visited from the left, the right and the bottom.<br><br>The Euler tour first progresses to a left child if there is one, then progresses to it's parent, then it's next child, then it's parent's parent.",4.5
14, it runs through the parents and the children in order ,3
15," it starts node on the left of the root and then proceeds to visits each node in a left to right order, visits the root, and then proceeds to repeat the previous step on the right side of the tree.",3.5
16," Travel from the root to the farthest left child<br>Backup, travel the leftmost children in the right side<br>repeat until reaching the rightmost child.",4.5
17," has preorder, in order, and postorder of a tree.  preorder = puts the parent node in front of the child node(s).  in order = puts the parent node between the left child and right child node(s).  postorder = puts the parent node after the child node(s).",3.5
18," The Euler traveral is when you go through a tree looking for nodes to put in the order of left, root, right. Like inOrder traversal. ",4
19," An Euler traversal is a traversal that begins with the root, and travels around the outside of the tree.  Each element in the tree is visited 3 times.  From the left, from the bottom and from the right.",5
20, Euler tour traversal of a tree traverses down each branch straight to one leaf then starts again at the root and repeats until all elements have been traversed.,4
21," The Euler tour visits every node in a tree, starting with the root and working around the tree counterclockwise. in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversals can be seen as variations of the Euler tour traversal.",4.5

23, to traverse going down to the left then go to the right of last children and back to the top.. kind of like going around the tree,5
24," You recursively visit every node on the list. You visit the node from the left, the bottom, and from the right.",5
25," the euler tour is a way to traverse a tree where you come into contact with each node three times, from the left, from the right, and from the bottom",5
