0, A function that calls upon it self to solve a problem.  Each time it calls upon it self it splits up a problem into a simplier form until it reaches a 'base case' which is the most simplest form of the problem.,5
1, A function that calls itself to perform an opperation such as a factorial recursive function.,5
2, not answered,0
3, A base case that calls upon itself until the problem becomes smaller and terminates.,4
4, It's a function that calls itself. It runs multiple times until the base case is reached.,5
5, a function that calls itself untill it reaches a base case.,5
6," A function that calls itself. Each time it does, it must get smaller, and eventually MUST converge to a base case, otherwise you can start an infinite loop.",5
7, a function that calls itself until a base case is met,5
8, A function that calls itself. With each function call the problem is diminished.,5
9, A function that calls itself to perform a certain task,5
10, A recursive function is a function that calls itself. Usually called the base case. If the base case is not correct it causes a infinite loop.,5
11," A function that calls itself, in order to solve a problem.",5
12," a function that calls itself over and over until it finds the simplest form of solution, or the base case.",5
13," A recursive function is a function that calls itself repeatedly until a base case is achieved. The fundamental idea is to break one large problem into a series of smaller, similar problems.",5
14," A recursive function typically simplifies a problem by calling itself, until arriving at a base case, at which it recursively returns a solution.",5
15," A recursive function is a function that breaks down a large problem into two or more smaller problems and calls itself to solve those smaller problems until a base case or terminating point is reached.  At the base case, a definite answer is called and the function no longer recurses, but unwinds itself back through function calls to determine the answer to the original large problem.",4.5
16, a function that calls itself into a loop with a base case for a loop exit.,4
17, a function that calls itself until the base cases are met.,5
18, A recursive function only knows how to solve base cases<br><br>A recursive function calls itself directly or indirectly until a base case is reached.,5
19, a function that calls on itself and uses a base case to stop the recursion,5
20," a function that calls itself, and which eaach calls get closer and close to the base case.",5
21, A function that divides and conquers a problem.  There is a base case that will eventually be reached.  The function calls itself over and over until the base case is satisfied.,5
22, a function that calls itself in the definition code,5
23, A recursive function solves a problem by repeatedly calling itself. the initial problem is broken into successively smaller parts until a much simpler base case is reached. the solutions to each piece of the problem are then returned a step at a time.,5
24," It invoke by itself again ana again, unless it reach bas case",4.5
25," a function that solves a problem by dividing the problem into smaller problems, by calling its self again and again, until a base case is reached.",5
26," A function that calls itself over and over again till a base case is reached, then it returns back to the original function.",5
27," a recursive function is a function that during execution, calls itself over and over until a base case is reached",5
28, A function that calls itself. Usually used to split a problem into several smaller problems of the same type.,5
29, function that calls it self till the base case is met ,5
