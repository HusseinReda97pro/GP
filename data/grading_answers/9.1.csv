 A data structure in c++ which is a collection of data that is kept in order.  First in first out.,5
 a queue is a list of objects in a particular order that is read one at a time starting at the first followed by the second and so on.,4
 A queue is an abstract data structure in which operations are performed at both ends giving the queue first in first out behavior.,5
" A queue stores a set of elements in a particular order.  Its principle of operation is FIFO(first in first out), which means the first element inserted is the first one to be removed.",5
 An ADT whose first inserted item is the first item removed. This uses the FIFO idea where items enter a queue at its back and leave at its front.,5
" Last in, last out architecture. It works the same way a line at the bank would work, the person that's been waiting the longest gets served first.",5
 a queue is a data structure that stores elements in a First in First out order.,5
 A waiting list of items that operation in a FIFO (first in first out) order.,5
" A queue is similar to an array, except that the data can only be accessed sequentially rather than at random. Unlike a stack, a queue follows FIFO. First in, First out.",5
 is a particular kind of collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position and removal of entities from the front terminal position. First in First Out (FIFO Method).,5
 Like a linked list but first in first out,4.5
 A queue is a FIFO data structure.,5
 A queue is a first in first out data structure.,5
" Its like a stack, but uses the linked list to stack a little differently. It's FIFO so the first thing enqueued is the first thing dequeued",5
" A first in, first out Abstract Data type that can be used to store values.",5
" Stores a set of elements in a particular orderwith a First In, First Out principle",5
 object that stores elements in order that follows first in first out.  the first element added is the first one to come off.,5
" A quese is an list that stores a set of elements in a particular order. It has Stack principle, but in this case, its ""First In, First Out"". The first element inserted is the first element to be removed.",5
" a finite ordered list with zero or more elements, based upon First In First Out",5
 a data structure that performs operations in the order of first in first out FIFO,5
" A Queue is a ""first in first out"" data structure, such that the first element added is also the first removed.",5
" Queue is a buffer, which store element in a particular order",3.5
" stores a set of elements where the first element in, is the first element to be removed",5
 A data structure that removes nodes from the head and adds nodes at the tail.,5
 a queue is a list of things that follows the first in first out behavior,5
" a queue is a storage container that holds its objects in a first in, first out priority",5
" The queue is another data structure. A physical analogy for a queue is a line at a bank. When you go to the bank, customers go to the rear (end) of the line and customers come off of the line (i.e., are serviced) from the front of the line.",5
