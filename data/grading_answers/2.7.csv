3, No,0
4," A header file consists of ""reusable"" source code such as a class in a file that by convention has a .h filename extension. This differs from .cpp files that contain ""source-code.""",3.5
5," To provide information about the contents of a library. It includes the definition of classes, declarations of functions, data types, and constants.",4.5
6, the header file shows the user what types go into and come out of a function but does not allow a user to manipulate the actual code for the function.,4.5
7, Header files declares the class member functions.,3.5
8, A header file allows for the separation of declaration and implementation into separate files. ,4
