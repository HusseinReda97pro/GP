1, They differentiated by the compiler by the conditions/inputs used for one of the overloaded functions.,3
2," The compiler distinguishes overloaded functions by their signatures. It encodes each function identifier with the number and types of its parameters to generate type-safe linkage, which ensures the proper overloaded function is called.",5

30, overloaded function simply invovles haing a method with the same name within the class. is used to implement a method for subclass which overrides in other words replaces the implementation of the super class. Overloading the concept of providing different meaning to a object based on the context of its presence. Overloading is one type of polymorphism and this is also a feature in programing. ,3
