0," at least 2, depending on how many arrays are being used.",2.5
1, all of them.,3.5
2," When passing a multi-dimensional array, all dimensions must be specified except for the first dimension.",5
3, It depends what parameters you are passing in a multidimensional.  A multideminsional can have more than two dimensions.,3.5
4, The first dimension is not required however the subsequent dimension(s) are needed for the compiler.,5
5, all but the first,5
6, All of the dimensions must be specified.,3.5
7, just the first one at least.,2
8," Two paramaters, the array and how many columns.<br> array(a[],[3])",4
9," The size of the first dimension can be omitted, same as a regular array. However, for every dimension outside the first, the size of those dimensions must be specified when passed, for example, a multi-dimensional array of [2][4][6] with the name MultiArray would be passed as: ""MultiArray[][4][6], 2""",4.5
10, Size of subsequent dimensions are required. Compiler must know how many elements to skip to move to the second element in the first dimension<br><br>,4.5
11, Every dimension after the first.,5
12, both,2.5
13," the size of the first dimension does not need to be specified, but all other dimensions do.",5
14," when passing (in main) a multidimensional array to a function, no dimensions need be specified",2
15," All dimensions except for the first one need to be specified when passing an array to a function, the compiler needs to know how many memory addresses to skip to make it back to the 2nd element in the first dimension.  The size of the first dimension does not need to be specified.",5
16, as many as there are dimensions. Most commonly just rows and columns,3.5
17," at least 2, but it should always equal the number of dimensions that the argument is expecting... like... <br>blah[][][][] will require 4 dimensional array input.<br>blah[][][] will require a 3 dimensional array.<br>blah[][] will require a 2 dimensional array.",3
18," None, just pass the array name.",2
19, all subsequent dimensions after the first dimension.  first is not needed to be specified.,5
20," all dimensions, excluding the first one.",5
21, all dimensions but the first<br>,5
22, the first needs to be specified by size and the rest need only be stated( first like this [3] then [][][]),3
23, one less than the number of dimensions the array contains,4.5
24, not answered,0
25, one,2
26, All subsequent dimensions after the first one.,5
27, two or more,2.5
28, 1 less than the total number of dimensions,4.5
29," Multi dimensional arrays are accessed using more than 1  index, one for each dimension at least. ",3.5
